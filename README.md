## Blockly Editor
This is an example of a block-based code editor that supports compiling to JS, Python, Dart, and C#. Block-based programming has become increasingly popular following the rise of Scratch, MIT App Inventor (and clones), Thunkable, and other editors.

This project is `in development`, and lacking MOST core features. The end project aims to:
- Be able to edit C# files in a blockly interface and interact with Godot games
- Have a full blockly web interface with development tools
- Generate human-readable C# code and allow exporting to other platforms

## @RANUX Version (Original)
Modified version of Blockly editor with file load\save feature and C# code generation.
For file load from server you can share Blockly on Web Server.
